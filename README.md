# Black-Scholes-Project
A small project using the Black-Scholes model.

I will continue to develop this app as I continue learning. So far, the app can calculate the price of a call or put option using the Black-Scholes model. It can also provide a heatmap to visualize the model. The user has the option to enter a ticker to access real time stock price data using the python library yfinance. I look forward to continuing to work on this project and please let me know if you have any suggestions!
