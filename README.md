# Black-Scholes-Project
An independent project on option pricing.

I will continue to develop this app as I continue learning. This app was made using streamlit.

So far, the app can calculate the price of a call or put option using the Black-Scholes model or the Binomial model. The user can choose which one to use. The app can also provide a heatmap to visualize the Black-Scholes model. The user has the option to enter a ticker to access real time stock price data using the python library yfinance. I look forward to continuing to work on this project and please let me know if you have any suggestions!

If the app has gone to sleep, feel free to wake it up!
